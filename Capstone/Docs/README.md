# Aneury Perez: Letter of Intent

# RWCUST

this project aim to help customer to engage more the way the spend their "Money" and help business to grow their customer base by
getting new customer by open their offer to the network by using the blockchain to spread their offers.


# before

in the current state of the world loyalty's programs and rewards program are well spread with the situation the most of them or almost all 98% 
offer to specific market or close business, this works well almost always but by implementing this project the benefict would increase both party 
user/customer and business that has offer. below I will detail common use case.


### Use Case

- generate campaigns for offer reward
- generate offers of rewards 
- manage customer by usage of the loyalties rewards
- spread business name over some kind of merchandise over the chain  
- processing fee for using services *to research*
- comunicate over off-chain information
... more to come.


#### How ?

to cover those use case we need to implement Smart-contract that help maybe implement some kind of escrow contract in order to share between user(Business, Customer) maybe integrate with 
something I watching a lot as theory Souls bound Token wich allow customer contain their tokens as solely owner.
